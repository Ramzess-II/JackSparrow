Jack Sparrow's compass was an unusual navigational instrument most notably used by Captain Jack Sparrow, having previously been bartered from the voodoo mystic Tia Dalma and inherited from Captain Morgan.
For those who knew how to use it, the compass was the key to everything. Unlike an ordinary compass, Jack's compass pointed to what the owner wanted most, rather than mere magnetic north.
